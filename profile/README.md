# My Vision

[中文版](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8MH5TRtfE1zvt-ivmYevGw)

I believe the future of human-AI collaboration isn’t about treating AI as just a tool—it’s about aligning AI’s understanding with our own thinking processes. It’s about creating a shared context where humans and AI can truly work together, amplifying each other’s strengths to solve complex problems, uncover insights, and bring ideas to life.

This belief didn’t come out of nowhere. Over the past months, I’ve been spending hours in conversations with AI like ChatGPT and Claude. Each interaction was fascinating, full of potential, but also frustrating. Valuable ideas and insights emerged during these dialogues, but they were often fleeting, lost in endless conversation threads. I couldn’t help but wonder: **what if we could capture and build on these moments, transforming them into something more meaningful?**

Traditional approaches, where you input a single question and receive a response, work well for immediate, isolated queries. But what about when your questions are part of something bigger? What about when you’re working through a larger idea or trying to solve a problem that requires layers of context? Repeating the same information, copy-pasting previous results, or stitching together fragments of past conversations interrupts the creative flow and wastes time. AI can have memory, but it’s not dynamic enough to truly match how humans think.

This gap is what inspired me to create **Dessix**.

Dessix was born from a simple but powerful idea: **what if AI could see exactly what you’re focusing on? What if it could align itself with your perspective—your context—and help you think, write, and create more effectively?** That’s the vision behind Dessix. It’s a tool designed to give you complete control over the context AI works with, allowing it to seamlessly integrate into your thinking process. You see what the AI sees, and together, you can build something greater.

## The Core of My Vision

At the heart of Dessix is the belief that **context is everything**. Instead of treating AI as an isolated assistant, Dessix bridges the gap by enabling dynamic, structured collaboration. Here’s what I envision:

- **Shared Context** \
  Humans and AI should work from the same foundation. With Dessix, the content you’re focusing on—whether it’s notes, articles, references, or multimedia—becomes the shared context for collaboration. What you see is what AI sees. This transparency eliminates guesswork and creates a natural flow of interaction.
- **Empowered Thinking** \
  Creativity often stems from the ability to combine different, seemingly unrelated ideas. Dessix enables this by letting you organize and connect blocks of information dynamically—notes, tweets, YouTube videos, and more—into meaningful structures. These blocks are not just static data; they are interactive stepping stones that drive deeper thinking and better conversations.
- **Effortless Organization** \
  Managing context can be overwhelming. Dessix helps by presenting only what’s essential, limiting visible blocks to the 5-7 elements your mind can comfortably process at a time. This intentional design encourages focus, minimizes distractions, and ensures that both you and AI stay aligned on what truly matters.
- **Dynamic Insight** \
  Dessix doesn’t just record information; it transforms it into a living, evolving resource. By enabling real-time adjustments to your context, it ensures every conversation is relevant, insightful, and productive. Whether you’re drafting an idea, solving a problem, or simply exploring, Dessix adapts to help you uncover connections and insights you might have missed.

## Looking Ahead

Dessix is just the beginning of what I see as a much larger movement—a shift toward tools that truly integrate with human cognition. I envision a world where AI doesn’t just assist us but collaborates with us, helping us organize the chaos of information into clarity, insight, and action.

In the future, I see Dessix evolving into a space where structured thought meets creative exploration, where every note, every question, and every conversation builds toward something greater. Imagine AI that not only responds to your questions but actively helps you refine your ideas, challenge assumptions, and discover new possibilities—all while respecting your context and goals.

## A Call to Co-Creators

This vision isn’t something I can achieve alone. Dessix was born from my own frustrations and needs, but I know I’m not the only one feeling this way. If you share this belief—if you see the potential for tools like Dessix to redefine how we think, work, and create—I’d love to hear from you. Together, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible and shape the future of human-AI collaboration.

The future is bright, and it’s full of possibilities. Let’s build it together.
